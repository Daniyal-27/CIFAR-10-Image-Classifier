# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN (Keras Sequential API)

This project demonstrates how to train a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the **CIFAR-10** dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 mutually exclusive classes.

## Dataset Overview

The CIFAR-10 dataset contains:
- **50,000 training images** distributed across five batches (10,000 images each).
- **10,000 test images**, with exactly 1,000 images per class.

### Classes in the Dataset:
1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck

The classes are mutually exclusive:
- **Automobile** includes sedans, SUVs, etc.
- **Truck** includes only big trucks (not pickup trucks).

## Getting Started

This code is designed to be run on **Google Colab**. Follow the steps below to execute the training process.

### Pre-requisites

- Python 3.10 or above
- TensorFlow (Keras) installed in Google Colab
